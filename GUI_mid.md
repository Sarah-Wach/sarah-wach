## Initial GUI Prototyping

### 1. Low-fid Prototype

The next step is to bring your concept on a higher visual and interactive level (on content level itâ€™s going to be placeholder data of course). You can use any GUI prototyping tool (I recomment Axure, proto.io, figma or Adobe XD, but go ahead and make your own experience). Your final prototype is a browser-based, interactive application (means, no EXE for instance), depending on your tool you need to export/deploy.
