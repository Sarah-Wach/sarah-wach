## The Wallet Project

The Wallet Project is a “quick wash” proposed by the d.school of Hasso Pattner’s Institute of Design at Standford to practise each phase of the Design Thinking approach.

<style>
.pic {
  height: 50vh;
  background-image: url("assets/wallet.png");
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
</style>
  <div class="pic"></div>

### 1. Empathize

I collaborated with Luna during this Design Thinking circle. 

These are my meaningful questions to understand her thoughts while interacting with the actual wallet. 

* __Please describe at the beginning how your wallet looks and feels.__
    * It's pink, rectangle-shaped, a usual women's wallet, not that expensive, smooth material, easy to disinfect 
    
* What is the best and the worst thing about your wallet?
    * good: lots of storage space
    * to improve: the size is irrelevant since it does not fit in the trouser pocket
    * The smartphone doesn't fit into the wallet, even it is so big
    * Many coins in it
    
* What does your wallet contain?  (It's ok to give me some examples :blush:)
    * EC cards/ Visa Card
    * ID card
    * many other cards
    * Coupons
    * donation cards
    * Medicine
    
* Where is it stored?
    * Hold in Hand (does not like purses)
    * When she leaves the house: wallet, keys, cell phone are always with her
    
* Which payment methods do you use most?
    * rather with card

* When do you use the wallet?
    * To pay
    * for shopping
    * always takes it with her, never goes out without it
    * At doctor's appointments
    * To the library

* Have you ever lost your wallet?
    * Only for a few minutes, because I forgot it in an IKEA, but I got it back quickly :dizzy:
