### Design Challenge: Elaboration of a design study that deals with telepresence and that invites interaction. 

The goal of the design study is to create a project that deals with telepresence and invites interaction. All users should be able to access a graphical environment via a web page and change conditions there, such as the weather. 
Several actions are to be triggered by different controls. In addition, the actions can be combined, so that seemingly infinite results are possible. 
With the help of effects, the environment is to appear even more real, for example, a parallax effect and a panning effect are to be used. 
For the implementation of the project, three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library, is used. This allows the environment to be manipulated with effects and animations. 
The final environment is inspired by a camping situation in nature and includes mountains in the background and a tent next to a tree in the foreground. This should then be accompanied by the tactile sliders to change the environment. These hover in the lower left corner of the image above the actual content.
