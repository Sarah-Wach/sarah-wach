## Workshop — IoT (Organic Electronics)

> Physical Computing with Drawn, Organic Electronics
In this exercise block we are going to investigate new approaches of interaction design with smart paper to create interactive posters, books, cards, wallpapers, packagings, …
The tool shelf I send to you is pretty simple: a pencil, some wires and (the brain) an ESP32. Furthermore you need and USB Micro cabel and paper (and of course additional material, such as wires if you want to create an interactive system based on more then just one input sensor).


My little sister is learning to play the piano and usually has lessons to get better at it. Due to Corona, her exercises are very sporadic right now and soon may not be. So I thought a mini piano could be set up in a convenient place in the house so she can stay in practice.

**Concept Idea:** After activating, a specified part piece of music, which is to be practiced, is played through a speaker. Then a tone is sounded to indicate that it is the player's turn. During the exercise, red and green LEDs light up to show whether everything has been done correctly. The individual keys of the piano can be touched and are linked to the GPIOs by using wires.
