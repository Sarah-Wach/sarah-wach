## Exercise /#03
## Responsive Design Challenge


### Tablet Version

> There are some use-cases where the location-based screen in the meeting room is not sufficient: when meetings take place in another office, for instance when discussions about the plant production numbers are discussed directly on the production line with the foremen and ciefs. Thus, we need an adaptation of this big screen systems for tablets.

### Smartwatch Version

> Last week we presented the big screen systems to our Vice President and Senior Directors. We came up with the idea to run this system on our smartwatches. You know, this would be a great activity in our digital transformation to promote our company. We need a proof of concept for the upcoming fair presentation next summer.
