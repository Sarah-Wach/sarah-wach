## SWOT

This is the analysis of myself:
> Strengths

My bachelor's course, which was strongly based on the design (and not so much on coding), allowed me to become creative in interaction design several times during my studies.
Something I enjoyed and learned a lot in all projects was the idea generation and research phases. I like to develop new ideas and find solutions to problems.
For one project, where I created something for schools, my team and I visited a school where we could have closer look at how a day is created and what needs the teachers and students have.
With this knowledge, we created our first ideas and later the prototypes. The final prototype included a new login solution for students. With the help of an RFID key ring and a reader paired with new learning software, the Computer science lessons worked a lot smoother and easier.

In earlier projects, I always worked a lot on conception and creative implementation. In this way, I try to bring group work forward.

For my bachelor thesis, my fellow student and I created a mobility app. It supports individual travel planning through multimodal mobility offers. The app contained many different statuses and options. In the beginning, all starts with a chat and picture-based onboarding, which is easy to use and understand for all users. It also contains many features, like a changeover guide at train stations, a helpful community, or different options in the booking procedure for traveling.

If you want to have a closer look at what I've done bevore, here is a link to my [behance](https://www.behance.net/sarahwach) profile. There you can find my work from my Bachelor studies and more detailed descriptions.


> Weakness

My (self-determined) focus was already in my studies, designing new products and solutions, and learning from the experiences of others. I already had some insights into programming, but somehow the spark never flew. So far I've gained insights into different programming languages. I have already worked with Framer and CoffeeScript. I have also worked on several projects with Arduinos and Raspberries. This was more fun than producing software solutions.

> Opportunities

I would be particularly interested in different design principles and methods to reach the goal faster and more orderly. The human being and his experiences and different perceptions and reactions to situations fascinate me. And I think you can never learn enough about that. During testings and interviews, I have always been able to take something new with me. Most of the time, all these new insights flowed directly into new ideas and concepts. Different styles are also always exciting. Creating guides for them or designing a project according to procedures or guidelines can be interesting. Topics that I see above all in social networks are, for example, also micro-interactions. Little things that make it easier to use the software, but can also distract from essential tasks.

> Threats (Risks)

I see distance learning as something critical to me. Even without "physical" contact with others, keeping motivation high could be a challenge. Even conversations that sometimes happen, such as when changing rooms in the corridor, will be missing. On the other hand, I do not see that topics could become too theoretical. Of course, it is important to experience and create things yourself, but a theoretical background is also good. This way you can learn a lot of new skills that you would otherwise have learned by trial and error. I also hope that discussions will inspire new perspectives.
