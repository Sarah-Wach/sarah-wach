## SWOT

This is the analysis of myself:
> Strengths

My bachelor's course, which was strongly based on the design (and not so much on coding), allowed me to become creative in interaction design several times during my studies.
Something I enjoyed and learned a lot in all projects was the idea generation and research phases. I like to develop new ideas and find solutions to problems.
For one project, where I created something for schools, my team and I visited a school where we could have closer look at how a day is created and what needs the teachers and students have.
With this knowledge, we created our first ideas and later the prototypes. The final prototype included a new login solution for students. With the help of an RFID key ring and a reader paired with new learning software, the Computer science lessons worked a lot smoother and easier.

In earlier projects, I always worked a lot on conception and creative implementation. In this way, I try to bring group work forward.

For my bachelor thesis, my fellow student and I created a mobility app. It supports individual travel planning through multimodal mobility offers. The app contained many different statuses and options. In the beginning, all starts with a chat and picture-based onboarding, which is easy to use and understand for all users. It also contains many features, like a changeover guide at train stations, a helpful community, or different options in the booking procedure for traveling.

If you want to have a closer look at what I've done bevore, here is a link to my [behance](https://www.behance.net/sarahwach) profile. There you can find my work from my Bachelor studies and more detailed descriptions.


> Weakness

My (self-determined) focus was already in my studies, designing new products and solutions, and learning from the experiences of others. I already had some insights into programming, but somehow the spark never flew. So far I've gained insights into different programming languages. I have already worked with Framer and CoffeeScript. I have also worked on several projects with Arduinos and Raspberries. This was more fun than producing software solutions.

> Opportunities



> Threats (Risks)
