## SWOT

This is the analysis of myself:
> Strengths

My bachelor's course, which was strongly based on design (and not so much on coding itself), allowed me to become creative in interaction design several times during my studies.
One thing that I thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot in all projects were the ideation and research phases. I like it to create new ideas and find solution for problems. 
For one projekt, where I created some thing for schools, my team and I visited a school where we could have c closer look how a day is created and what needs the teachers and studends have.

If you want to have a closer look at what I've done bevore, here is a link to my [behance](SWOT.md) profile. There you can find my work from my Bachelor studies and more detailed descriptions.


> Weakness



> Opportunities



> Threats (Risks)
